# Congress.gov API Beta Working Group 

The purpose of this repository is to communicate with Congressional data partners in support of developing the Congress.gov API that is anticipated to be released to the public at a future date to be determined. Development of the repository includes: 

- Python and Java sample code
- Documentation (similar to Bill Status XML Bulk Data user guide) 
- Two-way communication for Congressional data partners
- Change management communication
- User documentation with clear information about Congressional data publishing workflows 

The purposes of the Congress.gov API: 

- Support Congressional data partners (by protecting them from scrapers that degrade Congress.gov access) 
- Facilitate more complete and and more accurate Congressional data
- Provide useful, extensible resource for Congressional data partners
  
As of January 2022, this repository is restricted to select Congressional data partners. This repository is anticipated to become public, after Congressional data partners X.
