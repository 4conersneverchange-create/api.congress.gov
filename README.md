# Congress.gov API Beta Working Group 

The purpose of this repository is to communicate with Congressional data partners in support of developing the Congress.gov API (v3) that is anticipated to be released to the public at a future date. Development plans to be supported within the repository include: 

- Python and Java sample client code
- Two-way communication for Congressional data partners
- Change management communication
- User documentation (similar to [Bill Status XML Bulk Data user guide](https://github.com/usgpo/bill-status/blob/master/BILLSTATUS-XML_User_User-Guide.md)) with clear information about Congressional data publishing workflows 

The purposes of the Congress.gov API (v3): 

- Support Congressional data partners (by protecting them from scrapers that degrade Congress.gov access) 
- Facilitate more complete and and more accurate Congressional data
- Provide useful, extensible resource for Congressional data partners
- Replace Congress.gov API (v2)
  
The initial Congress.gov API (v3) is implemented as a RESTful read API that is presented as a hierarchical browse API.

As of May 2022, this repository is restricted to select Congressional data partners. At a future date and consultation with select Congressional data partners, the goal is to invite a limited number of public users to participate in a public beta working group. At a future date (we are targeting September 2022) the goal is to "go live" with a  beta version of the API to all.
