# Congress.gov API Beta Working Group 

The purpose of this repository is to communicate with Congressional data partners in support of developing the Congress.gov API (v3) that is anticipated to be released to the public at a future date. Development plans to be supported within the repository include: 

- Python and Java sample code
- Two-way communication for Congressional data partners
- Change management communication
- User documentation (similar to [Bill Status XML Bulk Data user guide](https://github.com/usgpo/bill-status/blob/master/BILLSTATUS-XML_User_User-Guide.md)) with clear information about Congressional data publishing workflows 

The purposes of the Congress.gov API (v3): 

- Support Congressional data partners (by protecting them from scrapers that degrade Congress.gov access) 
- Facilitate more complete and and more accurate Congressional data
- Provide useful, extensible resource for Congressional data partners
- Replace Congress.gov API (v2)
  
The initial Congress.gov API (v3) is implemented as a RESTful read API that is architected as a hierarchical browse.

This repository is anticipated to become public after close consultation with Congressional data partners. 
As of January 2022, this repository is restricted to select Congressional data partners. 
With consultation with the select Congressional data partners, we will open up this space to a limited number of public users.

By the end of September, the goal is to go live with the beta version of the API available to all.
